## Overview
This is a Flask web app which predicts fare of Flight ticket.
## Motivation
What to do when you are at home ? I started to learn Machine Learning model to get most out of it. I came to know mathematics behind all supervised models. Finally it is important to work on application (real world application) to actually make a difference.
