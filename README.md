## Overview
This is a Flask web app which predicts fare of Flight ticket.

## Motivation
What to do when you are at home ? I started to learn Machine Learning model to get most out of it. I came to know mathematics behind all supervised models. Finally it is important to work on application (real world application) to actually make a difference.

## Installation
The Code is written in Python 3.6.10. If you don't have Python installed you can find it [your link here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). If you are using a lower version of Python you can upgrade using the pip package, ensuring you have the latest version of pip. To install the required packages and libraries, run this command in the project directory after [cloning](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository) the repository.

pip install -r requirements.txt
